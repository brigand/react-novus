Every boilerplate is missing things you want, and comes with stuff you don't need.
This project tries to address this by allowing you to configure which technologies
and patterns you want in your react app.

Pick your data store, router, css preprocesor, build tool, and more. There are also
helpful presets if you don't know what you want.

The configs are based on [create-react-app], the official project creation tool
from facebook. It's high quality, but missing many of the tools you want.

[create-react-app]: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

## Usage

The easiest way to configure it is to use the [interactive web app][1].

Command line support may come in the future, but it's not a priority.

## Issues

This project is pretty complex, and difficult to automatically test. You may end
up with code that doesn't work. Please file an issue and share your config/novus.json
file, which allows us to reproduce the build.
